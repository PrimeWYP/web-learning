        Lyrics
        
        A painted heart on a sidewalk
        A bleeding sun on a silver screen
        I feel my ego when I talk
        Lost myself in the in between
        Lustful eyes filled with love now
        Sending in every calvary
        A few more souls on the bus now
        Shut my eyes right at 17
        Always hits me
        I'm always shifting
        Take my hand
        Now and forever
        Where I stand
        How can you live and let die
        Young man, look in the mirror
        Take my hand and don't you ever let go
        Take my hand now and forever
        Take my hand now and forever
        Don't you ever let go (take my hand now and forever)
        Take my hand now and forever
        Told myself maybe someday
        I'd fall down from the centerpiece
        I treat my mind like an ashtray
        I owe you an apology
        Breaking plans on a Sunday
        With myself maybe make some peace
        I forgot every birthday
        Open eyes right at 23
        Always hits me, yeah
        I'm always shifting
        Take my hand
        Now and forever
        Where I stand how can you live and let die
        Young man look in the mirror
        Take my hand and don't you ever let go
        Take my hand now and forever
        Take my hasnd now and forever
        Don't you ever let go (take my hand now and forever)
        Take my hand now and forever
        Pick apart all of the pieces
        Well, I'm running out of time
        Iron out all of the creases and just hang it out to dry
        Shallow hearts for shallow minds
        That ache to be alive
        You fall apart and redefine what keeps you up at night
        Oh, take my hand
        Now and forever
        Where I stand just as you're losing yourself again
        Look in the mirror
        Take my hand
        Now and forever
        Where I stand
        How can you live and let and die
        Young man look in the mirror
        Take my hand
        And don't you ever let go
        Take my hand now and forever
        Take my hand now and forever
        Don't you ever let go (take my hand, now and forever)
        Take my hand now and forever
