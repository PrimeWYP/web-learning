            Lyrics

            A painted heart on a sidewalk
            A bleeding sun on a silver screen
            I feel my ego when I talk
            Lost myself in the in between
            Lustful eyes filled with love now
            Sending in every calvary
            A few more souls on the bus now
            Shut my eyes right at 17
            Always hits me
            I'm always shifting
            Take my hand 
            Now and forever
            Where I stand
            How can you live and let die
            Young man, look in the mirror
            Take my hand and don't you ever let go
            Take my hand now and forever
            Take my hand now and forever
            Don't you ever let go (take my hand now and forever)
            Take my hand now and forever
            Told myself maybe someday
            I'd fall down from the centerpiece
            I treat my mind like an ashtray
            I owe you an apology
            Breaking plans on a Sunday
            With myself maybe make some peace
            I forgot every birthday
            Open eyes right at 23
            Always hits me, yeah
            I'm always shifting
            Take my hand
            Now and forever
            Where I stand how can you live and let die
            Young man look in the mirror
            Take my hand and don't you ever let go
            Take my hand now and forever
            Take my hand now and forever
            Don't you ever let go (take my hand now and forever)
            Take my hand now and forever
            Pick apart all of the pieces
            Well, I'm running out of time
            Iron out all of the creases and just hang it out to dry
            Shallow hearts for shallow minds
            That ache to be alive
            You fall apart and redefine what keeps you up at night
            Oh, take my hand
            Now and forever
            Where I stand just as you're losing yourself again
            Look in the mirror
            Take my hand
            Now and forever
            Where I stand
            How can you live and let and die
            Young man look in the mirror
            Take my hand
            And don't you ever let go
            Take my hand now and forever
            Take my hand now and forever
            Don't you ever let go (take my hand, now and forever)
            Take my hand now and forever
